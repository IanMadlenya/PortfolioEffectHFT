PortfolioEffectHFT v1.2 (Release date: 2015-09-29)
==============

First commit.

New functionality:

* Auto-calibrating model pipeline for market microstructure noise, risk factors, price jumps/outliers, tail risk (high-order moments), price fractality (long memory) that was built to give tick-resolution analytics.
* Over 40+ portfolio and position-level metrics of intraday risk and performance from modern and post-modern portfolio theory.
* Single-period constraint portfolio optimization (classic Markowitz and extensions for tail risk) with scalar, vector-based and user-defined functional constraints
* Multi-period constraint portfolio optimization that accounts for previous portfolio rebalancing (trading strategy optimization).
* Transactional costs were also implemented in this release.
